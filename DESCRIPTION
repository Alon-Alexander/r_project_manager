Description: Enforces and supports a standardized folder structure for research
    projects. Researchers can focus on analysis while the package handles
    organization of code and results, reproducible input references, and
    discovery of outputs across analyses. Supports artifact discovery by ID,
    format-agnostic reading, and chaining outputs between analyses.
